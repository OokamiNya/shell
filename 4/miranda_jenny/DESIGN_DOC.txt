The Magic Conch Shell
by Jenny Baran and Miranda Chaiken

Features:
	Forks and executes commands!
	Parses multiple commands on one line!
	Redirects using >, <!
	Handles pipes.
	Evaluates basic addition and subtration expressions (ie. 3 + 4 -7)
	super secret unicorn command
	
Attempted:
	Multiplication and division were going to happen but level of
	difficulty outweighed reward

Bugs:
	None that we know of
	
Files & Function Headers:
shell.c
	Handles parsing, forking, and executing.
	/*======== static void sighandler() ==========
	Inputs:  int signo
	Returns: N/A

	Catches keyboard interrupt. If currently in a child process,
	exits that process. Otherwise, exits the shell.
	====================*/

	/*======== char * rmspaces() ==========
	Inputs:  char * str 
	Returns: Pointer to the beginning of str

	Removes leading and trailing whitespace on the string line.
	Terminating '\0' is placed at a new location if necessary.	====================*/

	/*======== void execute() ==========
	Inputs:  char * split_cmds
	Returns: N/A

	Takes string containing one command and however many args
	apply to it. Creates an array of args. Forks and runs with
	execvp. In the case that the cmd is cd or exit, handles with
	chdir() or exit(), respectively.
	====================*/

	/*======== void calculator() ==========
	Inputs:  char * str
	Returns: N/A

	Takes string containing an algebraic expression of basic
	addition and mulitplication and prints the result.
	====================*/

	/*======== void printUnicorn() ==========
	Inputs: N/A
	Returns: N/A

	Untold mysteries 
	====================*/

	/*======== int main() ==========
	Inputs: N/A
	Returns: 0
	
	Deals with piping, redirection, multiple cmds on one line, and
	determines if math is involved.
	Otherwise, calls execute on cmds.
	====================*/
