Zilbash
by Alex Zilbersher

Features:
	Forks and executes commands
	Parses multiple commands on one line
	Can use exit command
	Can change directory and do another command on one line using ;
	Prints out "Exited Zilbash" if it receives a kill -2 (SIGINT)
	Recognizes and states bad commands
	//Redirects using >, <

Attempted:
	The following did not end up working, but have been left
	in the code, commented out.

Bugs:
	Putting two ;'s next to each other will break the parser
	
Files & Function Headers:
main.c
	The driver, handles signals and runs main()
	/*======== int main() ==========
	Has no inputs and returns 0
	
	forks process for run_command() in shell.c
	====================*/

shell.c
	Handles some of the forking and the executing of commands
	/*======== int run_command(char* s) ==========
	Inputs: char* s
	Returns: 0

	Will parse and execute each command in s recursively until
	they are all completed. If s is null, it will then wait for a new input. 
	This function also calls change_directory(char** args) to change
	the directory, rather than do that itself
	====================*/

	/*======== int change_directory(char** args) ==========
	Inputs: char** args
	Returns: 0

	Takes in the cd command from run_command(char* s) and
	uses its arguments to change the current process's directory. 
	Will print out "Directory not found: <PATH>" if the directory
	was unable to be found.
