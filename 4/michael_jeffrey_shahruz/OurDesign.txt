	Nope

Files & Function Headers:

main.c

      	exec_line
		Input: parse & edited command
		Output: NULL
		
		Runs execvp on the command provided.

	trim
		Input: command
		Output: NULL
		
		Removes spaces in the front and back of a string so that
		it can be inserted to exec_line without exec_line returning
		an error.
	
	runs_command
		Input: raw command-line input
		Output: NULL

		The brain of the whole operation. Takes in the command in its
		raw form and then cycles it through trim if necessary. Then, the
		function determines if the command is a special case (>,>>,<,|
		exit,cd). If it is, the command is handled by the "if" 
		statements. If not, the command is run through exec_command.
	wrkdir
		Input: none
		Output: formatted string version of the cwd
		
		Simply formats the current working directory down into a string 
		which can be used as the common prompt.
